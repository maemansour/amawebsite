Features include: slug-based routing (`/api/committees/:slug`), flexible optional fields (heroImage, missionImage, image1/2/3, applyLink, email, social media URLs) to accommodate different committee types, ImageUploadWithCrop components for all committee images, dropdown committee selector for easy navigation, full CRUD operations through storage layer, and automatic cache invalidation ensuring changes immediately reflect on public pages. Committee detail pages (Consulting, Podcast, EventPlanning) fetch data via slug-specific API endpoints using full URL path query keys (`["/api/committees/consulting"]`) to ensure correct data loading.

### Backend
- **Framework:** Express.js with TypeScript on Node.js.
- **API Design:** RESTful API with endpoints for settings, events, highlights, newsletter (subscribe, view all subscriptions, delete subscription), admin, executive members (including bulk reorder endpoint), sponsors (with full CRUD and bulk reorder endpoint), slideshows (with full CRUD and bulk reorder endpoint), portfolio clients (with full CRUD), committee configs (centralized management for all 7 committees with slug-based routing), and object storage.
- **Authentication:** Session-based authentication using `express-session` with HTTP-only cookies; `requireAuth` middleware for admin routes.
- **Database:** Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect (configured for Neon Database).
- **Schema:** Tables for `settings` (site configuration, images including sponsor page images, committees page images, consulting committee page images, membership page images, and podcast page images, plus membership pricing fields: semesterPrice, yearPrice, joinNowLink, calendarSubscribeUrl for Google Calendar/iCal subscription, and podcast-specific fields: podcastHeroImage, podcastIndustryImage, podcastCreativeImage, podcastSpotifyUrl, podcastInstagramUrl, podcastYoutubeUrl, podcastEmail, podcastApplyLink), `events` (club events with title, description, date, time, location, category), `highlights`, `newsletter_subscriptions`, `users` (admin accounts with bcrypt hashed passwords), `executiveMembers` (board members with team organization and displayOrder for custom sorting), `sponsors` (partner organizations with name, category, description, image, and displayOrder for carousel sorting), `slideshows` (brand-specific slideshow collections with title and displayOrder), `slideshowSlides` (individual slides within slideshows with image URL and displayOrder, cascade delete on parent slideshow removal), `portfolioClients` (consulting committee client portfolio entries with semester, clientName, clientUrl, and displayOrder for custom sorting), `alumniSpotlight` (featured alumni profiles with name, class year, position, company, description, profile image, LinkedIn URL, and displayOrder), `featuredSpeakers` (podcast committee speakers with name, topic, description, category (recent/past), and displayOrder for custom sorting), and `committeeConfigs` (centralized committee configuration supporting all 7 committees with slug-based routing, flexible optional fields for heroImage, missionImage, image1/2/3, applyLink, email, and social media URLs to accommodate different committee types).
- **Key Design Decisions:** Middleware for request logging, environment-specific configurations, Drizzle ORM with Zod validation. Executive member ordering uses displayOrder field exclusively—team order is derived from member order, not alphabetically, ensuring consistency between admin panel and public website. Specific routes (like `/reorder`) must be defined before parameterized routes (like `/:id`) in Express routing.
- **Image Upload System:** Three dedicated upload components:
  - `ImageUploadWithCrop`: For site-wide images (hero sections, sponsor images, committees images, consulting committee images, membership images, podcast page images, etc.) with configurable aspect ratios, uploads via `/api/objects/upload`, normalizes URLs via `/api/chapter-images`. Supports multiple image types including hero, mission, whyChoose, services, family, executiveBoard, sponsorsHero, sponsorsPartner1, sponsorsPartner2, committees, committeesWhyJoin, consultingTeam, consultingMission, membershipHero, membershipEngagement, podcastHero, podcastIndustry, and podcastCreative.
  - `MemberImageUpload`: For executive member profile pictures with 1:1 circular crop, stores normalized `/objects/xxx` paths directly in database.
  - `SlideImageUpload`: For slideshow slide images with 16:9 aspect ratio cropping, uses per-instance refs to support multiple instances on same page, stores normalized `/objects/xxx` paths directly in database.

## External Dependencies
- **Database:** Neon Database (PostgreSQL-compatible serverless) via `@neondatabase/serverless`.
- **Object Storage:** Replit Object Storage (Google Cloud Storage backend) via `@google-cloud/storage` for admin-uploaded images.
- **UI Components:** Radix UI, Shadcn UI, Embla Carousel (with Autoplay plugin), React Hook Form, Zod, Lucide React, React Icons.
- **Drag & Drop:** `@dnd-kit/core`, `@dnd-kit/sortable`, `@dnd-kit/utilities` for drag-and-drop reordering of executive board teams/members, sponsors, slideshows, and slides within slideshows.
- **Development Tools:** Vite, ESBuild, TypeScript.
- **Fonts:** Google Fonts (Inter, Poppins).
- **Session Management:** `connect-pg-simple` (available for PostgreSQL-backed sessions, currently using in-memory).
- **Social Media:** Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, Spotify (links configurable).
